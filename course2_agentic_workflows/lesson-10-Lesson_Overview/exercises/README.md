# Use Case: Warehouse Inventory Management
Scenario:
A warehouse system is used to track the inventory of products. When a product reaches a critical low level, it triggers a reorder process. Additionally, a periodic audit must be conducted to ensure product count accuracy.

We'll explore two workflows:

Deterministic Workflow – A fixed, pre-scripted set of tasks for inventory management.

Agentic Workflow – A dynamic, agent-based process that adapts based on data and conditions.

Exercise Task:
Create a deterministic workflow for managing the warehouse inventory.

Design an agentic workflow where intelligent agents handle tasks such as checking inventory levels, creating orders, and conducting audits.
